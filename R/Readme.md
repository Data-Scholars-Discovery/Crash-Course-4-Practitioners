# Introduction to R and RStudio

Have you always wanted to learn data science but worry about the level of math and statistics involved? Are you completely new to programming but interested in learning R? This online course is for you! 

The Crash Course 4 Practitioners is designed for people with little background in formal statistics to get up to speed on data science, fast. Step-by-step tutorials, slides, and video lectures will guide you through the most important concepts and commands to import, clean, visualize, and analyze data. While not a replacement for a more thorough R program, this course can break through the initial learning curve to help you understand the more advanced material out there.

To get started, we recommend downloading Anaconda and the associated RStudio application, which will be your main user interface for Python programming.

## Navigating the Course

This course provides tutorial script files (in the .rmd format, for RStudio), step-by-step HTML Guides (which you can open in your browser), Beamer HTML slides, and Slidy HTML slides. The variety is just to accommodate different formatting preferences, they all contain the exact same content. We also provide RevealJS slideshow presentations, though due to file dependencies these are only in the ZIP file versions of the sessions. There are also YouTube video lectures corresponding to each section, which will be uploaded and linked soon within each file and on this readme! 

The only other requirements to get started are downloading the files in the `Data` folder at the base of this GitHub repo. If you've never used GitHub before, you just have to clone and download a ZIP folder of the entire repo by clicking on the big green button at the top right of the repo screen. This will give you a local copy of all the files contained inside (including for Python and Stata, if you want to learn those). All data files are also provided as links in the scripts (to Kaggle or other sources).

Everything in this guide is and will always be free and open source, so you are welcome to use, distribute, or copy it as you like! Please just be sure to provide credit to the appropriate authors of the material! Otherwise please feel free to share the data science revolution with as many friends as possible!
