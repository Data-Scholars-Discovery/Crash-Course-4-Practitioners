    "Python is a powerful open-source programming language that is popular among  data scientists and other computer programmers for its versatility and capacity to interface across different platforms. You can code in Python directly from the command line, but for reproducibility and ease-of-use many people prefer using a graphical user interface or notebook system. The most popular is Jupyter Notebook, as it combines robust functionality with an appealing clean interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python operates like most programming languages (and is quite similar to R or Stata, if you've ever used those), in that it has its own grammar and vocabulary based on commands and functions. Code is usually written in scripts or notebooks (like this one) and executed directly within the script environment. Jupyter Notebook is a bit different from other graphical user interfaces in that it doesn't have a separate console where you can execute code. Everything is done using the cells within the Notebook text. Otherwise it is very similar, offering traditional navigation tabs like \"File\" and \"Edit\" at the top.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have never used a Jupyter Notebook before, check out [this intro guide from Real Python](https://realpython.com/jupyter-notebook-introduction/) for more info on how it works! Jupyter actually isn't just for Python (the PYT in JuPYTer) but will run R code as well.\n",
