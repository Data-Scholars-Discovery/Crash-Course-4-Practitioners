# Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks

Have you always wanted to learn data science but worry about the level of math and statistics involved? Are you completely new to programming but interested in learning Python? This online course is for you! The Crash Course 4 Practitioners is designed for people with little background in formal statistics to get up to speed on data science, fast. Step-by-step tutorials, slides, and video lectures will guide you through the most important concepts and commands to import, clean, visualize, and analyze data. While not a replacement for a more thorough Python program, this course can break through the initial learning curve to help you understand the more advanced material out there.

To get started, we recommend downloading Anaconda and the associated Jupyter Notebooks application, which will be your main user interface for Python programming.
